using pyhton 3 app.py is only good for testing and development

for final build we need a:
    Web Server Gateway Interface

one we shall use is called
Gunicorn

it is installed via pip3

to run an app with Gunicorn

// gunicorn application:app

gunicorn __bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 5 application:app
